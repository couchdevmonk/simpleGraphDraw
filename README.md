# simpleGraphDraw
A simple python code to visually draw a graph and get the corresponding adjacency matrix.

The program uses pyGame to make a canvas to draw vertices and edges on it. It also comes with a barebones UI to change modes between vertex addition or edge addition along with the features to save the adjacency matrix in a file or save the graph as a PNG file.

#### Packages used
1. pyGame
2. numPy
3. os
4. datetime

#### Featues
1. Add vertices or edges (toggle mode)
2. Clear the board
3. Save the underlying adjacency matrix and corresponding adjacencies in a text file
4. Save the graph as a PNG snapshot
5. Ability to move the vertices and the corresponding edges

#### Possible future features
- [ ] Add curved edges
- [x] ~Ability to move the vertices and the corresponding edges~ 
- [ ] Make a web version
